# Movement Study by Image Pointing
This Programm is a learning tool that enable anyone to easily study a movement of a Chronophotography, thanks to pointing
and calibrating. It also calculates the equations of the trajectory on the abscissa and ordinate axis, depending to the 
time, and so the speed and acceleration vectors, displayed on each center of mass.

### Instructions to use
1. Import the Image 
2. Place the points in the chronological meaning, by clicking on the System's center of mass
3. Calibrate by selecting a line, and by specifying the real distance 
4. Validate

After those steps, you can now see the trajectory line and equations, speed and acceleration vectors.
